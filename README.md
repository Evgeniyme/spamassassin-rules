## Spamassassin - What is it?

Apsamasassin is actually maintained by Apache now, this is great news as we know thye will maintain it for a very long time then. SpamAssassin is the #1 Open Source anti-spam platform giving system administrators a filter to classify email and block spam (unsolicited bulk email). It uses a robust scoring framework and plug-ins to integrate a wide range of advanced heuristic and statistical analysis tests on email headers and body text including text analysis, Bayesian filtering, DNS blocklists, and collaborative filtering databases.

> So keywords here are "scoring framwork". Keep this in mind, it will help you understand why my rules do as they do.

## Custom rules

Overview on all custom rules and some basic information on how to install them and how to use them. By default spamassassin and amavis if setup propperly will automatically include all *.cf files under /etc/spamassassin.
